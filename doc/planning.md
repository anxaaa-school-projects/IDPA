# Planning

Before starting this project, I took some time to plan ahead in order to avoid wasting time on refactoring the code later if something needed to be done differently.

I outlined my ideas in [this Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I1TKDZZO-J2w-6c60Onxl_0QAO_lC4riVjcmg8gWdN8/edit?usp=sharing).

Please note that the document is written in German and that not everything is explained in great detail. I kept things concise, as the document is intended to serve as a guideline rather than a full documentation of the final product.
